I have used flask for developing APIs using pyhton.

I have used "extcolors" library for extracting colors from image.
Extcolors gives all colors in an image with pixel count and they are in decreasing order.
So I picked up first two with first denoting the logo color and second primary color of logo. I have experimented this task using Kmeans clustering for color extraction from image but it is not giving desired result then I switched to Extcolor library.
